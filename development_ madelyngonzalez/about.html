		<h2 class="aboutmetitle"> About Madelyn</h2>
		<p>Madelyn is a senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Consumer Behavior and Marketplace Studies in the School of Human Ecology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She is also pursuing certificates in both Entrepreneurship and Digital Studies. </p>
	<p>Madelyn is passionate about digital marketing, consumer behavior, and brand awareness. Her top strengths include Customer Service, Leadership, and Communication. These strengths have been amplified through her work as a digital marketing/ social media intern, restaurant manager, and various clubs, and intramurals that the university offers. Upon graduation, she hopes to pursue a career in digital marketing.</p>

<p>At the end of Madelyn’s junior year, she worked for Geneva Supply Interstate Music, a 360° Solution for E-Commerce, providing one-of-a-kind assistance for every step of the process. Geneva Supply specializes in brand management, logistics, creative services, and digital marketing. During her time at Geneva Supply, she worked as a digital marketing and social media intern where she had the opportunity to create engaging content through social media and blog posts. She also had the opportunity to job shadow every employee at the company which allowed her to connect the dots and gain a glimpse into how each piece of the puzzle fits and works together. In doing so, she discovered her love for digital marketing. </p>

<p>She states, “I really love how digital marketing allows me to not only use my analytical skills, but also my creative skills as well. I hope to one day work with brands in order to optimize their content on the world wide web and help them flourish.”</p>

<p>Madelyn is actively seeking employment as she will be graduating in May of 2023.</p>
